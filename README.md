# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
Bobby's manager has assigned the tasks of determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. A report will need to be written to summarize the analysis and help Bobby's manager prepare for the inevitable "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age

### Resources
- PostgreSQL  
- pgAdmin 4

## Results
- There number of retired employees who retire with a "Senior" in their title is overwhelming compared to the other titles shown in the table 
- These counts were saved to a retiring_titles csv file to keep record of how many employees retired with these specific titles

- The table displays only employess who were born in the year 1965. These retired employees fall in the mentorship eligibility program  
- A majority of employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program are mostly "Senior" staff. It is very beneficial to have an abundance of "Senior" staff as it can help promote better standardized training for younger employees

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?  
Since there is such a large group of "Senior" staff rertiring, it will be very stressful and difficult for Bobby's manager to replace that much staff without negative impact on production. In total, there are 72,458 employees who are retiring.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?  
There are only 1,549 employess eligible to participate in the mentorship program. There are not nearly enough employees to mentor the enxt generation of employees. If this were to maintain a consistent ratio, it would be roughly 70 people per mentoring employee. Learning environments with a large amount of students can be very detrimental to all parties involved as it will breed unhealthy competition and poor learning structures.
